# Lost and Found

Name:
Lost & Found (still thinking of a better name)

Description:
Whether one is working, running and errand, or even just lounging at home, people still have the tendency to be forgetful and misplace their belongings. This is especially common when one is in a hurry or subjected to hectic conditions. This app would implement a "lost-and-found" system that allows users to both (1) search for a lost item within a vicinity (could be on a campus, in a mall, at a park, or just a general area) or (2) indicate that they have found a misplaced item that belongs to another â€“ by making a posting with details such as the location found, pictures, item description, and tags (for searching ability).

Functionalities to Consider:
- A rating/credibility system that shows users are actual people who legitimately trying to help people in the community
- Timeframe and additional details in a posting
- User contact information (have some be required and others be confidential)
- Notifications every time an object similar to what one is finding, gets posted

Potential Issues:
- Security/Reliability
- Communication methods
